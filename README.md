Led FoodShare, a collaborative platform aimed at addressing food scarcity by connecting surplus food donors, NGOs, and users. This initiative empowered local farmers with sustainable market opportunities, reducing food waste and supporting communities. Utilizing PHP for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, I developed a cloud-based system featuring real-time food tracking, seamless donation workflows, and user-friendly interfaces. The project significantly decreased food waste and provided crucial support to those in need, demonstrating a successful blend of technology and community service.
